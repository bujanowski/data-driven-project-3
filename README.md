ğŸ¥• In this project I was looking at the carrots. Yep! I looked at how expensive carrots are in Russia. 

ğŸ¥• I took data for the last five years from the Federal State Statistical Agency. 

ğŸ¥• Then I cleaned the data in pandas and plottet a chart.

ğŸ¥• Then I saved the chart as a pdf and made some cosmetic changes in Adobe Illustrator.
