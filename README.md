# data driven project 3

In this project I was looking at the carrots. Yep! I looked how expensive carrots are in Russia. 
I took  data for the last five years from the Federal State Statistical Agency. 
Then I cleaned the data in pandas and plottet a chart.
Then I saved the chart as a pdf and made some cosmetic changes in Adobe Illustrator.
